# Deployment Checklist

## Before Transferring:
- [ ] Run 'npm run build:portable' on source PC
- [ ] Verify the package was created successfully
- [ ] Check that all files are in dist-portable/lucky-draw-system/

## On Target PC:
- [ ] Install Node.js 18+ (if not already installed)
- [ ] Copy the entire 'lucky-draw-system' folder
- [ ] Navigate to the folder in terminal
- [ ] Run 'start.bat' (Windows) or './start.sh' (Linux/Mac)
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

## If Issues Occur:
- [ ] Check Node.js version: node --version (should be 18+)
- [ ] Check if port 3000 is available
- [ ] Verify all files were copied (especially .next/standalone and .next/static)
- [ ] Check terminal for error messages
- [ ] Ensure database directory (prisma/) exists and is writable

## Important Notes:
- The database (prisma/dev.db) will be created automatically on first run
- Do NOT delete the .next/standalone or .next/static folders
- Do NOT delete the node_modules/.prisma folder (if included)
- The application requires Node.js to run (not a standalone executable)
